Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2017",Color: Soft black,"I purchased the speaker in March 2017, and here 4 months later it has stopped working. I used the below method to reset the speaker and it's working fine again. strange bug for a product line that I've always enjoyed.Plug soundlink in to wall charger- Hold down the play/pause button for 15 seconds.- Then, BEFORE releasing the play/pause button, unplug the charge cord from the unit.- Release the button,- Plug the unit back into the wall charger.- Press the power button, and your unit should power on."
Toads n Frogs,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2018",Color: Soft black,"I was surprised in every way upon the Sound Link Color II's arrival, connection and playback of music.To start with, the instructions were so poor, it made us wonder if we bought a fake from China.  We later found an online manual, and wondered why it was not included with our speaker.  Not to worry though, we had a lengthy set of safety precautions in twenty-one, I kid you not - twenty-one, different languages.Bose is a great name, right?  Every Bose product we have ever listened to exceeded expectations and most of the time left us in awe.  My wife and I listened to the Sound Touch 10 (cousin of Sound Link?) in Sam's and were thinking the Sound Link Color II would be just as amazing.  It's not - the Sound Link Color II sound is just average.  It is a little better than our four year old Phillips speaker, but comes no where near matching the sound of our two year old Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker.  The speaker's bass is nearly non-existent, and it will not play as loud as either of the two other speakers we compared it with.  The absence of the Bose ""wow!"" left us very disappointed.  Looking through the manual we found online, Bose indicates the speaker works best when backed up close to, but not against, a wall.  An odd piece of guidance given Bose's advertisement of the speaker as an on the go, outside, camping/swimming/party speaker.  We did try the guidance though, and it did seem to add a little more bass.  But not nearly enough to overcome the speaker's sound shortcomings.The rubbery speaker exterior is nice - some reviewers indicated it was a lint/dust trap, but we did not find it such.  It felt good, provided a solid feel and seemed consistent with the speaker's water resistant claim.The speaker has a VERY annoying feature when charging - it beeps every 15-20 seconds or so.  We could not find a way to turn the beep off anywhere in the Bose literature.  Online, we found this irritant was very common and can be fixed by using a non-Bose micro USB cable.  And indeed, the online fix eliminated the problem.  Not a big deal cost-wise, but the flippin' cable has Bose's name on it!  This is Bose for Pete's sake, you expect better.The app was a non factor.  Not useful, not a problem.  It was much easier to go Settings/Bluetooth, connect to the Bose Sound Link Color II and then play music from your music library.  The app has no features, other than perhaps it's stereo/party mode where you need two Sound Link Color II speakers.  Yeah right, like that's gonna happen.This was a VERY disappointing buy.  I spent an embarrassing amount of Black Friday and Cyber Monday time looking for any kind of deal on the Sound Link Color II - to no avail.  I reasoned it was Bose, and the sound would more than compensate for a few dollars.  Bad call on my part.  I bought our Harmon Kardon Onyx a couple of years ago via a Black Friday deal.  It cost less than the Sound Link Color II and yet dramatically outperforms the Bose.A disappointing speaker, and not worth the Bose premium in my opinion."
Gloria nuñez,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2018",Color: Soft black,"I always wanted to have a bose speaker. I finally bought it and love it! It sounds really great but I have used it’s for less than a month and I left it charging for 6 hours because I was going camping and when I got to camp it hadn’t charge, I thought my cable wasn’t working but I have charged other devices with it and worked perfect. I put it to charge today for 4 hours and when Ari turned it on it said “battery low” and shut off. I am kind of disappointed with this speaker. Specially because I have been wanting to get it’s for this long!"
Jeff,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2017",Color: Soft black,"I bought this to pair with an Echo Dot.  Setup was very easy - almost effortless.  Sound is much better than what the Dot, or even the full-sized Echo, can produce, and I am very pleased with its performance.Deducted one star because it comes with a charging cable only - the wall plug is not included.  I'm guessing their theory is that it will be charged by a computer and used on the go.  And, yes, ""everyone"" has a wall plug anyway.  But to package a product without all necessary accessories is just not right."
cdale52,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2018",Color: Soft black,"Don’t buy this!  I bought this in mid-January 2018 & within a month the power just went dead. It wouldn’t charge no matter what connecton I used. Looked on the net for help & found that dozens of other folks have experienced the same problem. Some were able to eventually get it to work again, but many, like me, couldn’t.  I also have the original Bose Sound Link & that still works great after more than a year. I highly recommend that over the Sound Link II."
TimetheAvenger,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2017",Color: Soft black,"I like this speaker. I bought it to replace the Bose Soundlink speaker (original edition).  The sound is great, and it fits into the case I bought for the original, so that's nice.Now for the annoyances: The on/off, Bluetooth, and volume up+ and down- buttons are harder to press than on the original. The thing that bugs me the most is that they are VERY poorly marked--the icons are pale and almost impossible to see, so you have to look hard at them when you want to adjust something, until you know their placement and can do it by memory!Battery life is average.One thing I DO like about this speaker is that when you turn it on, a little voice says, ""Battery High"" or ""Battery Medium"" so that you know roughly how much charge you have remaining, so that things don't suddenly go silent!Let me clarify that:The voice says ""Battery High"" or ""Battery Medium"" ONLY when you turn it on. There's NO ""Low battery"" warning as you're using it. I have been sitting here working--and things suddenly went silent!So now I have to wait for it to charge--I don't know how long--until it will run off battery power as it charges so I can play Bluetooth music from my phone. It's been 20 minutes. Time to get out the 5-disc CD player from 1985 so I can have music in the house. Hey--it still works.UPDATE: after 3 hours of charging, it was still dead. I called Bose. Customer Service agent asked what was wrong with the speaker. I told him, ""It's stone dead!"" (Insert Monty Python parrot sketch here) We went through all the troubleshooting steps. Dead speaker, after 12 days.If you're going to buy one, definitely get the extended service plan!UPDATE#2: I received the replacement speaker for the one that died after 12 days on the 22 of July. On September 13, I turned it on and there was no sound. Called Bose. Went through all the troubleshooting steps. They were kind enough to put through the paperwork to send me a replacement. Still waiting on it, six days IS reasonable, I don't expect them to overnight it. Now I have to call the Extended Warranty people again to change the serial number again when it arrives. Seriously, people, buy the extended warranty! Money well spent."

Turns out I wasn’t. The speaker comes with a cable for charging, but not a plug. So I used whatever I had around.I charged this speaker overnight, sometimes for days, and still when I turned it on it would say, ‘ Low battery.’By chance, I was in my local AT&T store and bought a ‘cube’ and a cable to charge my phone.Turns out the cube I bought has ENOUGH AMPS and that seems to be the difference.So I used any ole cord that fit in the speaker plug and used my new, higher amp cube- lo and behold, speaker fully charged in no time.I am attaching a pic so you know what model I bought and as I said, I found it at AT & T, but if you found one with the same specs, I bet it would work just fine!Loving my speaker again!"

Within less that one month of use, it went dead.  Totally.  I contacted Bose, and they are sending a replacement, which I hope proves to be a lot more long lived.

Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on February 21, 2017",Color: Soft black,"Bought it once. Returned it because it stopped working soon after purchase. Bought it a second time, and it stopped working after initial battery charge. Called Bose. Re-set the processor per rep's instructions and topped off the battery charge. Used it for about 15 minutes. Died again. Completely dead again. Called Bose and was told that it shouldn't do that. Duh. Dog product. Returned for refund and will look for different speaker this time."

Toads n Frogs,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2018",Color: Soft black,"I was surprised in every way upon the Sound Link Color II's arrival, connection and playback of music.To start with, the instructions were so poor, it made us wonder if we bought a fake from China.  We later found an online manual, and wondered why it was not included with our speaker.  Not to worry though, we had a lengthy set of safety precautions in twenty-one, I kid you not - twenty-one, different languages.Bose is a great name, right?  Every Bose product we have ever listened to exceeded expectations and most of the time left us in awe.  My wife and I listened to the Sound Touch 10 (cousin of Sound Link?) in Sam's and were thinking the Sound Link Color II would be just as amazing.  It's not - the Sound Link Color II sound is just average.  It is a little better than our four year old Phillips speaker, but comes no where near matching the sound of our two year old Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker.  The speaker's bass is nearly non-existent, and it will not play as loud as either of the two other speakers we compared it with.  The absence of the Bose ""wow!"" left us very disappointed.  Looking through the manual we found online, Bose indicates the speaker works best when backed up close to, but not against, a wall.  An odd piece of guidance given Bose's advertisement of the speaker as an on the go, outside, camping/swimming/party speaker.  We did try the guidance though, and it did seem to add a little more bass.  But not nearly enough to overcome the speaker's sound shortcomings.The rubbery speaker exterior is nice - some reviewers indicated it was a lint/dust trap, but we did not find it such.  It felt good, provided a solid feel and seemed consistent with the speaker's water resistant claim.The speaker has a VERY annoying feature when charging - it beeps every 15-20 seconds or so.  We could not find a way to turn the beep off anywhere in the Bose literature.  Online, we found this irritant was very common and can be fixed by using a non-Bose micro USB cable.  And indeed, the online fix eliminated the problem.  Not a big deal cost-wise, but the flippin' cable has Bose's name on it!  This is Bose for Pete's sake, you expect better.The app was a non factor.  Not useful, not a problem.  It was much easier to go Settings/Bluetooth, connect to the Bose Sound Link Color II and then play music from your music library.  The app has no features, other than perhaps it's stereo/party mode where you need two Sound Link Color II speakers.  Yeah right, like that's gonna happen.This was a VERY disappointing buy.  I spent an embarrassing amount of Black Friday and Cyber Monday time looking for any kind of deal on the Sound Link Color II - to no avail.  I reasoned it was Bose, and the sound would more than compensate for a few dollars.  Bad call on my part.  I bought our Harmon Kardon Onyx a couple of years ago via a Black Friday deal.  It cost less than the Sound Link Color II and yet dramatically outperforms the Bose.A disappointing speaker, and not worth the Bose premium in my opinion."

It sounds really great but I have used it’s for less than a month and I left it charging for 6 hours because I was going camping and when I got to camp it hadn’t charge, I thought my cable wasn’t working but I have charged other devices with it and worked perfect. I put it to charge today for 4 hours and when Ari turned it on it said “battery low” and shut off. I am kind of disappointed with this speaker.

The sound is great, and it fits into the case I bought for the original, so that's nice.Now for the annoyances: The on/off, Bluetooth, and volume up+ and down- buttons are harder to press than on the original. The thing that bugs me the most is that they are VERY poorly marked--the icons are pale and almost impossible to see, so you have to look hard at them when you want to adjust something, until you know their placement and can do it by memory!Battery life is average.One thing I DO like about this speaker is that when you turn it on, a little voice says, ""Battery High"" or ""Battery Medium"" so that you know roughly how much charge you have remaining, so that things don't suddenly go silent!Let me clarify that:The voice says ""Battery High"" or ""Battery Medium"" ONLY when you turn it on. There's NO ""Low battery"" warning as you're using it. I have been sitting here working--and things suddenly went silent!So now I have to wait for it to charge--I don't know how long--until it will run off battery power as it charges so I can play Bluetooth music from my phone. It's been 20 minutes. Time to get out the 5-disc CD player from 1985 so I can have music in the house. Hey--it still works.UPDATE: after 3 hours of charging, it was still dead. I called Bose. Customer Service agent asked what was wrong with the speaker. I told him, ""It's stone dead!"" (Insert Monty Python parrot sketch here) We went through all the troubleshooting steps.

Toads n Frogs,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2018",Color: Soft black,"I was surprised in every way upon the Sound Link Color II's arrival, connection and playback of music.To start with, the instructions were so poor, it made us wonder if we bought a fake from China.  We later found an online manual, and wondered why it was not included with our speaker.  Not to worry though, we had a lengthy set of safety precautions in twenty-one, I kid you not - twenty-one, different languages.Bose is a great name, right?  Every Bose product we have ever listened to exceeded expectations and most of the time left us in awe.  My wife and I listened to the Sound Touch 10 (cousin of Sound Link?) in Sam's and were thinking the Sound Link Color II would be just as amazing.  It's not - the Sound Link Color II sound is just average.  It is a little better than our four year old Phillips speaker, but comes no where near matching the sound of our two year old Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker.  The speaker's bass is nearly non-existent, and it will not play as loud as either of the two other speakers we compared it with.  The absence of the Bose ""wow!"" left us very disappointed.  Looking through the manual we found online, Bose indicates the speaker works best when backed up close to, but not against, a wall.  An odd piece of guidance given Bose's advertisement of the speaker as an on the go, outside, camping/swimming/party speaker.  We did try the guidance though, and it did seem to add a little more bass.  But not nearly enough to overcome the speaker's sound shortcomings.The rubbery speaker exterior is nice - some reviewers indicated it was a lint/dust trap, but we did not find it such.  It felt good, provided a solid feel and seemed consistent with the speaker's water resistant claim.The speaker has a VERY annoying feature when charging - it beeps every 15-20 seconds or so.  We could not find a way to turn the beep off anywhere in the Bose literature.  Online, we found this irritant was very common and can be fixed by using a non-Bose micro USB cable.  And indeed, the online fix eliminated the problem.  Not a big deal cost-wise, but the flippin' cable has Bose's name on it!  This is Bose for Pete's sake, you expect better.The app was a non factor.  Not useful, not a problem.  It was much easier to go Settings/Bluetooth, connect to the Bose Sound Link Color II and then play music from your music library.  The app has no features, other than perhaps it's stereo/party mode where you need two Sound Link Color II speakers.  Yeah right, like that's gonna happen.This was a VERY disappointing buy.  I spent an embarrassing amount of Black Friday and Cyber Monday time looking for any kind of deal on the Sound Link Color II - to no avail.  I reasoned it was Bose, and the sound would more than compensate for a few dollars.  Bad call on my part.  I bought our Harmon Kardon Onyx a couple of years ago via a Black Friday deal.  It cost less than the Sound Link Color II and yet dramatically outperforms the Bose.A disappointing speaker, and not worth the Bose premium in my opinion."

It sounds really great but I have used it’s for less than a month and I left it charging for 6 hours because I was going camping and when I got to camp it hadn’t charge, I thought my cable wasn’t working but I have charged other devices with it and worked perfect. I put it to charge today for 4 hours and when Ari turned it on it said “battery low” and shut off. I am kind of disappointed with this speaker.

The sound is great, and it fits into the case I bought for the original, so that's nice.Now for the annoyances: The on/off, Bluetooth, and volume up+ and down- buttons are harder to press than on the original. The thing that bugs me the most is that they are VERY poorly marked--the icons are pale and almost impossible to see, so you have to look hard at them when you want to adjust something, until you know their placement and can do it by memory!Battery life is average.One thing I DO like about this speaker is that when you turn it on, a little voice says, ""Battery High"" or ""Battery Medium"" so that you know roughly how much charge you have remaining, so that things don't suddenly go silent!Let me clarify that:The voice says ""Battery High"" or ""Battery Medium"" ONLY when you turn it on. There's NO ""Low battery"" warning as you're using it. I have been sitting here working--and things suddenly went silent!So now I have to wait for it to charge--I don't know how long--until it will run off battery power as it charges so I can play Bluetooth music from my phone. It's been 20 minutes. Time to get out the 5-disc CD player from 1985 so I can have music in the house. Hey--it still works.UPDATE: after 3 hours of charging, it was still dead. I called Bose. Customer Service agent asked what was wrong with the speaker. I told him, ""It's stone dead!"" (Insert Monty Python parrot sketch here) We went through all the troubleshooting steps.

I used the below method to reset the speaker and it's working fine again. strange bug for a product line that I've always enjoyed.Plug soundlink in to wall charger- Hold down the play/pause button for 15 seconds.- Then, BEFORE releasing the play/pause button, unplug the charge cord from the unit.- Release the button,- Plug the unit back into the wall charger.- Press the power button, and your unit should power on."
Toads n Frogs,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on December 26, 2018",Color: Soft black,"I was surprised in every way upon the Sound Link Color II's arrival, connection and playback of music.To start with, the instructions were so poor, it made us wonder if we bought a fake from China.  We later found an online manual, and wondered why it was not included with our speaker.  Not to worry though, we had a lengthy set of safety precautions in twenty-one, I kid you not - twenty-one, different languages.Bose is a great name, right?  Every Bose product we have ever listened to exceeded expectations and most of the time left us in awe.  My wife and I listened to the Sound Touch 10 (cousin of Sound Link?) in Sam's and were thinking the Sound Link Color II would be just as amazing.  It's not - the Sound Link Color II sound is just average.  It is a little better than our four year old Phillips speaker, but comes no where near matching the sound of our two year old Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker.  The speaker's bass is nearly non-existent, and it will not play as loud as either of the two other speakers we compared it with.  The absence of the Bose ""wow!"" left us very disappointed.  Looking through the manual we found online, Bose indicates the speaker works best when backed up close to, but not against, a wall.  An odd piece of guidance given Bose's advertisement of the speaker as an on the go, outside, camping/swimming/party speaker.  We did try the guidance though, and it did seem to add a little more bass.  But not nearly enough to overcome the speaker's sound shortcomings.The rubbery speaker exterior is nice - some reviewers indicated it was a lint/dust trap, but we did not find it such.  It felt good, provided a solid feel and seemed consistent with the speaker's water resistant claim.The speaker has a VERY annoying feature when charging - it beeps every 15-20 seconds or so.  We could not find a way to turn the beep off anywhere in the Bose literature.  Online, we found this irritant was very common and can be fixed by using a non-Bose micro USB cable.  And indeed, the online fix eliminated the problem.  Not a big deal cost-wise, but the flippin' cable has Bose's name on it!  This is Bose for Pete's sake, you expect better.The app was a non factor.  Not useful, not a problem.  It was much easier to go Settings/Bluetooth, connect to the Bose Sound Link Color II and then play music from your music library.  The app has no features, other than perhaps it's stereo/party mode where you need two Sound Link Color II speakers.  Yeah right, like that's gonna happen.This was a VERY disappointing buy.  I spent an embarrassing amount of Black Friday and Cyber Monday time looking for any kind of deal on the Sound Link Color II - to no avail.  I reasoned it was Bose, and the sound would more than compensate for a few dollars.  Bad call on my part.  I bought our Harmon Kardon Onyx a couple of years ago via a Black Friday deal.  It cost less than the Sound Link Color II and yet dramatically outperforms the Bose.A disappointing speaker, and not worth the Bose premium in my opinion."
Gloria nuñez,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on May 2, 2018",Color: Soft black,"I always wanted to have a bose speaker. I finally bought it and love it! It sounds really great but I have used it’s for less than a month and I left it charging for 6 hours because I was going camping and when I got to camp it hadn’t charge, I thought my cable wasn’t working but I have charged other devices with it and worked perfect. I put it to charge today for 4 hours and when Ari turned it on it said “battery low” and shut off. I am kind of disappointed with this speaker. Specially because I have been wanting to get it’s for this long!"
Jeff,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 19, 2017",Color: Soft black,"I bought this to pair with an Echo Dot.  Setup was very easy - almost effortless.  Sound is much better than what the Dot, or even the full-sized Echo, can produce, and I am very pleased with its performance.Deducted one star because it comes with a charging cable only - the wall plug is not included.  I'm guessing their theory is that it will be charged by a computer and used on the go.  And, yes, ""everyone"" has a wall plug anyway.  But to package a product without all necessary accessories is just not right."
cdale52,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on March 26, 2018",Color: Soft black,"Don’t buy this!  I bought this in mid-January 2018 & within a month the power just went dead. It wouldn’t charge no matter what connecton I used. Looked on the net for help & found that dozens of other folks have experienced the same problem. Some were able to eventually get it to work again, but many, like me, couldn’t.  I also have the original Bose Sound Link & that still works great after more than a year. I highly recommend that over the Sound Link II."
TimetheAvenger,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2017",Color: Soft black,"I like this speaker. I bought it to replace the Bose Soundlink speaker (original edition).  The sound is great, and it fits into the case I bought for the original, so that's nice.Now for the annoyances: The on/off, Bluetooth, and volume up+ and down- buttons are harder to press than on the original. The thing that bugs me the most is that they are VERY poorly marked--the icons are pale and almost impossible to see, so you have to look hard at them when you want to adjust something, until you know their placement and can do it by memory!Battery life is average.One thing I DO like about this speaker is that when you turn it on, a little voice says, ""Battery High"" or ""Battery Medium"" so that you know roughly how much charge you have remaining, so that things don't suddenly go silent!Let me clarify that:The voice says ""Battery High"" or ""Battery Medium"" ONLY when you turn it on. There's NO ""Low battery"" warning as you're using it. I have been sitting here working--and things suddenly went silent!So now I have to wait for it to charge--I don't know how long--until it will run off battery power as it charges so I can play Bluetooth music from my phone. It's been 20 minutes. Time to get out the 5-disc CD player from 1985 so I can have music in the house. Hey--it still works.UPDATE: after 3 hours of charging, it was still dead. I called Bose. Customer Service agent asked what was wrong with the speaker. I told him, ""It's stone dead!"" (Insert Monty Python parrot sketch here) We went through all the troubleshooting steps. Dead speaker, after 12 days.If you're going to buy one, definitely get the extended service plan!UPDATE#2: I received the replacement speaker for the one that died after 12 days on the 22 of July. On September 13, I turned it on and there was no sound. Called Bose. Went through all the troubleshooting steps. They were kind enough to put through the paperwork to send me a replacement. Still waiting on it, six days IS reasonable, I don't expect them to overnight it. Now I have to call the Extended Warranty people again to change the serial number again when it arrives. Seriously, people, buy the extended warranty! Money well spent."
pdevi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2020",Color: Aqua Blue,"Ok, even though I had read the product reviews and knew that people had trouble getting and keeping this speaker charged, I thought that I would be the exception. Turns out I wasn’t. The speaker comes with a cable for charging, but not a plug. So I used whatever I had around.I charged this speaker overnight, sometimes for days, and still when I turned it on it would say, ‘ Low battery.’By chance, I was in my local AT&T store and bought a ‘cube’ and a cable to charge my phone.Turns out the cube I bought has ENOUGH AMPS and that seems to be the difference.So I used any ole cord that fit in the speaker plug and used my new, higher amp cube- lo and behold, speaker fully charged in no time.I am attaching a pic so you know what model I bought and as I said, I found it at AT & T, but if you found one with the same specs, I bet it would work just fine!Loving my speaker again!"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on January 12, 2017",Color: Polar white,"As with all Bose audio equipment, the sound quality of this device is superb, but its endurance--not so much.  Within less that one month of use, it went dead.  Totally.  I contacted Bose, and they are sending a replacement, which I hope proves to be a lot more long lived.  A word to the wise:  save the box and everything that came with the speaker, along with your receipt."
Chariel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2018",Color: Soft black,"Lets just hypothetically say that I bought this as a gift in December 2017 for an ungrateful person.  In September 2018 this same ungrateful person pissed me off, so naturally I decided to destroy this bose speaker. I ran water over it but i noticed the water rolling off. I then submerged it in water and watched until little bubbles formed.  I removed it and placed it back.  The next day,  this same ungrateful person is blasting perfect sound quality music from this damn speaker... al hypothetically of courseNeedless to say Bose has gained a loyal customer in myself"
